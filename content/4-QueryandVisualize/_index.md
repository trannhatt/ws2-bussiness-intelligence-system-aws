### Introduction

In this section, we will explore how to analyze and leverage data on the AWS cloud environment. First, we'll delve into using Amazon Athena for efficient and flexible data analysis. Then, we'll utilize it to explore by visualizing data using Amazon QuickSight, to gain a better understanding of the extracted insights. Following that, we'll dive into the application of machine learning in data analysis with Amazon SageMaker. Additionally, we'll also explore how to combine and process small files stored in Amazon S3 to create larger files using AWS Lambda Functions.
